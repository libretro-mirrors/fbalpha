<P>This dialog allows you to configure the folders that FB Alpha will search for roms. You can configure up to 8 folders to search in. Simply select the folder number from the tabs and then click <B>Browse...</B> to select the folder. Once you have finished click <B>OK</B> and if you have made any changes then FB Alpha will scan your roms.</P>

<P>The last two folders (numbers 7 and 8) are special cases. Usually FB Alpha will take the first file for a rom it finds and ignore any in the later folders. Any files placed in folder 8 will be searched as well as the first file found. So, if you have some roms that require extra files than that found in MAME (the Neo-Geo bios is a good example), then you could put the extra files in this folder.</P>

<P>It is recommended to put the Megadrive games in one of these special paths to prevent conflicts. Although, internally, FB Alpha uses an <I>md_</I> prefix for the Megadrive games shortnames, this prefix should not be applied to the zipfiles the roms are stored in. This means you can point the seventh or the eighth rom path at your MESS Megadrive software list folder and you're done.</P>

<P><B>DO NOT ASK US WHERE TO FIND ROMS. They are copyrighted and we can't help you.</P>
